## Configuration and Customization

### Changing Dates
To customize the term start date, midterm date, or final exam date, modify the following lines in the `<script>` section of the `index.html` file:
```javascript
const startDate = getCairoDate(2025, 2, 8); // Term start date (YYYY, MM, DD)
const midtermDate = getCairoDate(2025, 4, 5); // Midterm date (YYYY, MM, DD)
const finalDate = getCairoDate(2025, 5, 24); // Final exam date (YYYY, MM, DD)
```

### Changing Timezone
To change the timezone, update the `TIMEZONE` constant in the `<script>` section:
```javascript
const TIMEZONE = "Africa/Cairo"; // Replace with your desired timezone
```

```css
:root {

    --bg-gradient: linear-gradient(-45deg, #1a1a1a, #121212, #1a1a1a, #121212);
    /* ... other variables ... */
}
