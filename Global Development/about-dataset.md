**Global Economic, Environmental, Health, and Social indicators Ready for Analysis**

---

### üìù **Description**

This comprehensive dataset merges global economic, environmental, technological, and human development indicators from 2000 to 2020. Sourced and transformed from multiple public datasets via Google BigQuery, it is designed for advanced exploratory data analysis, machine learning, policy modeling, and sustainability research.

Curated by combining and transforming data from the [Google BigQuery Public Data program](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data), this dataset offers a harmonized view of global development across more than 40 key indicators spanning over two decades (2000‚Äì2020). It supports research across multiple domains such as:

* **Economic Growth**
* **Climate Sustainability**
* **Digital Transformation**
* **Public Health**
* **Human Development**
* **Resilience and Governance**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note on Missing Region and Income Group Data**

Approximately 18% of the entries in the `region` and `income_group` columns are null. This is primarily due to the inclusion of aggregate regions (e.g., *Arab World*, *East Asia & Pacific*, *Africa Eastern and Southern*) and non-country classifications (e.g., *Early-demographic dividend*, *Central Europe and the Baltics*). These entries represent groups of countries with diverse income levels and geographic characteristics, making it inappropriate or misleading to assign a single region or income classification. In some cases, the data source may have intentionally left these fields blank to avoid oversimplification or due to a lack of standardized classification.
